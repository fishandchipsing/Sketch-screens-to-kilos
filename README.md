# Sketch-screens-to-kilos
**A true measurements of your daily digital fatigue.**

* Have you ever had the problem quantifing the work you've done? 
* Is your boss never happy about how much you produced?
* Isn't it just complicated to assess the value of your daily production of wireframes or screens?

**Those days are over!**

Screen to Kilos is the first ever plugin to transform your daily fatigue into a measurable and understandable amount.
It tells you how many kilos of work you produced if you would print it on beautiful and precious 200g paper and it humanizes the data by giving you a reference in high quality food types lik Blue fin Tuna or Kobe beef.

This first version has sadly hardcoded prices, but i will try to incorporate some live data as soon as i learn some more cocoaScript.

Let your boss appreciate you and Enjoy your work one kilo at a time.
